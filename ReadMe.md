# The All in One
hi, it was my dream that i can download anything from 1 place and no issue of going to diffrent websites and downloading the files one by one, we even forget some softwares that we had and when we need it the most we don't have internet to download it so to give a fix to it i thought to make a power shell script which can download and install any software that we chose and a list of all the softwares will be given to the user i have a basic code of it ready but i want to change a lot of things which i will do in future but i don't want this idea to die so even you can help me, just clone this code and try to add more or make the GUI better
:) i hope we can make 1 place for all the downloads.
# If u are using my script now(Beta)
before running a script u should turn on the permitions by typing the following in powershell<br/>
To give permision use: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned<br/>
To remove permision use: Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted<br/>
now u can run the script file and all the downloads will be in C:\ReMo if u ever wanted to check
